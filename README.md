# Garlic

Your all in one app for recipe seaching, shopping lists, grocery store locations, and reviews.

[Garlic](https://paulz92.github.io/garlic/)

## Motivation

Our motivation for this project is to simplify the process of recipe search to cooked meal by allowing the user to search recipes, add to shopping list, and locate grocery stores all within one app. 

Our custom ingredient search, as well as health and dietary restriction dropdowns, allow the users to search for a recipe that fits their needs. 

New in town? No problem. Search by location and find the grocery stores nearest you to by the items on your list.

## Features

Polished UI and simple to use for an easy and effective user experience. Navbar for simple navigation, a home page with a carousel of images and the search functionality to call the Edamam Recipe API. 

Recipes display in an easy to read way complete with serving size and calories per serving. Ingredients, a link to the full recipe directions, and a link to add ingredients to shopping list round out the recipe card.

Shopping list that remains persistent due to shopping list being saved as a local storage array. Users can remove items from their list if they already have the ingredient in their pantry.
